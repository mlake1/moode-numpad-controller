# moOde Audio USB Numpad Controller

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Notice**: This is a personal project and is in early development and has not been extensively tested. Please test thoroughly before relying on it for critical applications. Issues and feedback are welcome!

Utilises a standard number pad to control playback, volume, radio stations, and system functions with physical keys. My aim was to have music playing with a single key press and without the need for a phone or screen.

## Hardware Requirements

### Raspberry Pi
- Only tested so far on Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi 3/4/5, 400/500, CM3/4/5, or Zero 2 W
- Running moOde Audio 9.x series

### USB Numpad
**‚úÖ Recommended: Kensington Wired Numeric Keypad model: K79820WW **
- [Product Link](https://www.kensington.com/en-gb/p/products/control/keyboards/wired-numeric-keypad/)
- Detected as: "Homertech USB Keyboard" (USB ID: 276d:1160)
- Full Linux HID compliance, works perfectly with triggerhappy

**‚ùå Known Incompatible: Targus AKP10EU**
- Firmware defect found with non-standard USB-HID implementation
- Sends KEY_NUMLOCK events with every key press
- Incompatible with Linux input event systems

**üîç Likely Compatible (Community Testing Needed)**
- Cherry Numpads KC 1000 SC, G84-4700, Stream series
- Need testing: Community reports welcome!

**Other Standard Brands**
 - Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, HP OEM numpads should work OK
 - Most mechanical keyboard brand numpads
 - Requirement: Must use standard USB HID implementation, if they follow the standards they should work perfectly, however it's generally not      possible to tell which controller they use prior to purchase

**To Test Follow These Steps:**
 - 1. Check USB detection
 '''bash
lsusb | grep -i keyboard
'''
- 2. Test key detection  
'''bash
sudo evtest
'''
 - 3. Look for standard KEY_KP codes
 - Should see: KEY_KP0, KEY_KP1, etc. (not custom codes)

**#Community Contributions: Please report your hardware compatibility results!**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install triggerhappy python3 curl
```

### 2. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mlake1/moode-numpad-controller.git
cd moode-numpad-controller
```

### 3. Run Installation Script
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### 4. Configure Your Radio Stations
Edit the station mappings in `moode_numpad_controller.py`:
```python
STATIONS = {
    '0': 'RADIO/Your Station 1.pls',
    '1': 'RADIO/Your Station 2.pls',
    # ... customise with your favorites
}
```

### 5. Start the Service
```bash
sudo systemctl restart triggerhappy
```

## üéπ Key Mappings - these can be updated as desired

### Radio Stations (Numpad 0-9)
| Key | Default Station |
|-----|----------------|
| 0 | Radio Swiss Jazz |
| 1 | BBC Radio 1 |
| 2 | BBC Radio 2 |
| 3 | BBC Radio 3 |
| 4 | BBC Radio 4 FM |
| 5 | Resonance Radio 104.4 FM |
| 6 | BBC Radio 6 Music |
| 7 | France Inter Paris |
| 8 | RTS - Couleur 3 |
| 9 | France Bleu Loire |

### Control Keys
| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Enter | Play/Pause |
| . (Dot) | Stop |
| + (Plus) | Volume Up |
| - (Minus) | Volume Down |
| = (Equal) | Mute Toggle |

### Special Functions
| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Tab | Clear Queue |
| / (Slash) | Show Status |
| * (Asterisk) | Local Music |
| Backspace | not working yet ~~Safe Shutdown~~ |
| Calculator | Clear Queue |

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

### 1. Create Wrapper Script
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/numpad-wrapper.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/moode_numpad_controller.py "$1"
```
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/numpad-wrapper.sh
```

### 2. Install Python Controller
```bash
sudo cp src/moode_numpad_controller.py /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/moode_numpad_controller.py
```

### 3. Configure Triggerhappy
```bash
sudo cp src/numpad-moode.conf /etc/triggerhappy/triggers.d/
sudo systemctl restart triggerhappy
```

### 4. Safe Shutdown
Safe shutdown functionality 
For this to work triggerhappy needs to run as moode default is running as nobody user which lacks sudo privileges

 /lib/systemd/system/triggerhappy.service
 change User=nobody to User=moode

 commands to run:
sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/triggerhappy.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart triggerhappy

## üîç Setup Verification

### Test USB Numpad Detection
```bash
# Check USB device
lsusb | grep -i keyboard

# List input devices
ls /dev/input/event*
```

### Discover Key Codes
```bash
# Interactive key testing
sudo evtest

# Monitor triggerhappy logs
sudo journalctl -u triggerhappy -f
```

### Find Radio Stations
```bash
# Query moOde database
sqlite3 /var/local/www/db/moode-sqlite3.db "SELECT name FROM cfg_radio WHERE type='f';"

# Check radio directory
ls -la /var/lib/mpd/music/RADIO/
```

## Configuration

### Customise Radio Stations
1. Add stations to moOde favorites via web interface
2. Update `STATIONS` dictionary in `moode_numpad_controller.py`
3. Use exact station names including `.pls` extension

### Add New Functions
1. Create function in Python controller:
```python
def your_function():
    """Your custom function"""
    result = execute_command('your_moode_command')
    print("Function executed")
```

2. Add to command handler:
```python
elif command == "your_command":
    your_function()
```

3. Add key mapping to `numpad-moode.conf`:
```
KEY_YOURKEY 1 /usr/local/bin/numpad-wrapper.sh your_command
```

4. Restart triggerhappy:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart triggerhappy
```

## Troubleshooting

### Keys Not Responding
```bash
# Check triggerhappy status
sudo systemctl status triggerhappy

# Monitor key events
sudo evtest

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u triggerhappy -f
```

### API Commands Failing
```bash
# Test API directly
curl "http://moode/command/?cmd=status"

# Check connectivity
ping moode

# Verify moOde web interface
http://moode
```

### Radio Stations Not Playing
- Verify exact station names match moOde favorites
- Check stations work in moOde web interface
- Ensure stations are properly added to favorites
