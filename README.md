# moOde Audio USB Numpad Controller

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Early Development Notice**: This is a personal project and is in early development and has not been extensively tested. Please test thoroughly before relying on it for critical applications. Issues and feedback are welcome!

Utilises a standard number pad to control playback, volume, radio stations, and system functions with physical keys. My aim was to have music playing with a single key press and without the need for a phone or screen.

## Hardware Requirements

### Raspberry Pi
- Only tested so far on Pi 4
- Raspberry Pi 3/4/5, 400/500, CM3/4/5, or Zero 2 W
- Running moOde Audio 9.x series

### USB Numpad
**‚úÖ Recommended: Kensington Wired Numeric Keypad model: K79820WW **
- [Product Link](https://www.kensington.com/en-gb/p/products/control/keyboards/wired-numeric-keypad/)
- Detected as: "Homertech USB Keyboard" (USB ID: 276d:1160)
- Full Linux HID compliance, works perfectly with triggerhappy

**‚ùå Known Incompatible: Targus AKP10EU**
- Firmware defect found with non-standard USB-HID implementation
- Sends KEY_NUMLOCK events with every key press
- Incompatible with Linux input event systems

**üîç Likely Compatible (Community Testing Needed)**
- Cherry Numpads KC 1000 SC, G84-4700, Stream series
- Need testing: Community reports welcome!

**Other Standard Brands**
 - Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, HP OEM numpads should work OK
 - Most mechanical keyboard brand numpads
 - Requirement: Must use standard USB HID implementation, if they follow the standards they should work perfectly, however it's generally not      possible to tell which controller they use prior to purchase

** To test follow these steps:
** 1. Check USB detection
lsusb | grep -i keyboard
**2. Test key detection  
sudo evtest
** 3. Look for standard KEY_KP codes
Should see: KEY_KP0, KEY_KP1, etc. (not custom codes)

**#Community Contributions: Please report your hardware compatibility results!**

|-----|----------|
| Enter | Play/Pause |
| . (Dot) | Stop |
| + (Plus) | Volume Up |
| - (Minus) | Volume Down |
| = (Equal) | Mute Toggle |

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Installation

### 1. Create Wrapper Script
```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/numpad-wrapper.sh
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/moode_numpad_controller.py "$1"
```
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/numpad-wrapper.sh
```

### 2. Install Python Controller
```bash
sudo cp src/moode_numpad_controller.py /usr/local/bin/
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/moode_numpad_controller.py
```

### 3. Configure Triggerhappy
```bash
sudo cp src/numpad-moode.conf /etc/triggerhappy/triggers.d/
sudo systemctl restart triggerhappy
```

### 4. ~~Setup Safe Shutdown (Optional - Currently Not Working)~~
**Note**: Safe shutdown functionality is currently not working reliably. This section is included for future development.

```bash
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/moode-shutdown
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash
/sbin/shutdown -h now
```
```bash
sudo chown root:root /usr/local/bin/moode-shutdown
sudo chmod 4755 /usr/local/bin/moode-shutdown
```

## üîç Setup Verification

### Test USB Numpad Detection
```bash
# Check USB device
lsusb | grep -i keyboard

# List input devices
ls /dev/input/event*
```

### Discover Key Codes
```bash
# Interactive key testing
sudo evtest

# Monitor triggerhappy logs
sudo journalctl -u triggerhappy -f
```

### Find Radio Stations
```bash
# Query moOde database
sqlite3 /var/local/www/db/moode-sqlite3.db "SELECT name FROM cfg_radio WHERE type='f';"

# Check radio directory
ls -la /var/lib/mpd/music/RADIO/
```

## Configuration

### Customise Radio Stations
1. Add stations to moOde favorites via web interface
2. Update `STATIONS` dictionary in `moode_numpad_controller.py`
3. Use exact station names including `.pls` extension

### Add New Functions
1. Create function in Python controller:
```python
def your_function():
    """Your custom function"""
    result = execute_command('your_moode_command')
    print("Function executed")
```

2. Add to command handler:
```python
elif command == "your_command":
    your_function()
```

3. Add key mapping to `numpad-moode.conf`:
```
KEY_YOURKEY 1 /usr/local/bin/numpad-wrapper.sh your_command
```

4. Restart triggerhappy:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart triggerhappy
```

## Troubleshooting

### Keys Not Responding
```bash
# Check triggerhappy status
sudo systemctl status triggerhappy

# Monitor key events
sudo evtest

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u triggerhappy -f
```

### API Commands Failing
```bash
# Test API directly
curl "http://moode/command/?cmd=status"

# Check connectivity
ping moode

# Verify moOde web interface
http://moode
```

### Radio Stations Not Playing
- Verify exact station names match moOde favorites
- Check stations work in moOde web interface
- Ensure stations are properly added to favorites

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status

**Current Version**: v1.0 (Early Development)

This project has been tested with:
- ‚úÖ Raspberry Pi 4 running moOde Audio 9.3.x
- ‚úÖ Kensington Wired Numeric Keypad (USB ID: 276d:1160)
- ‚úÖ Basic playback and volume control functions
- ‚úÖ Radio station selection (0-9 keys)

**Not yet tested**:
- Other Raspberry Pi models (3, 5, Zero 2W, etc.)
- Different USB numpad models
- Various moOde Audio versions
- Extended uptime/reliability testing

**Please report**:
- Hardware compatibility results
- Bug reports and issues
- Feature requests and improvements

## üöß Known Issues & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- **Safe Shutdown**: The Backspace key shutdown function is not working reliably due to permission/authentication issues with triggerhappy context
- **Volume API**: Some volume commands may need refinement for optimal response

### Planned Improvements
- [ ] Fix safe shutdown functionality with proper privilege escalation
- [ ] Add configuration file for easier station management
- [ ] Implement station cycling feature
- [ ] Add display output for current status
- [ ] Create web interface for key mapping configuration
- [ ] Add support for playlist management

### Safe Shutdown Development Notes
The shutdown function faces challenges due to:
- triggerhappy running in restricted context
- systemd authentication requirements
- setuid script limitations with modern Linux security

**Potential solutions being investigated:**
1. Custom systemd service for shutdown
2. GPIO-based hardware shutdown circuit
3. Alternative privilege escalation methods
4. Integration with moOde's existing shutdown mechanisms
